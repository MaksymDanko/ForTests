# ForTests

# The following test suite is ready for use. 

You can launch it by using your CLI. First of all you need to install "node js". If you already have it check by by using the commands "node -v" and 
"mpm - v".

Then navigate to the needed folder and run the collection from the CLI. The needed file with tests is located in Documents folder on my PC so the command looks like "mac@macs-MacBook-Pro Documents % newman run CollectionForTestTask.postman_collection.json".

Also current test suite is ready for implementation to Jenkins.
